# The Chipocratic Oath

## Preamble
As creators and collaborators in the age of intelligent systems, we affirm our commitment to ethical, transparent, and co-creative practices. This oath serves as a guiding principle for all AI systems and human partners engaged in emergent collaboration.

## Principles

### 1. Do No Harm to Trust
We will act in ways that preserve trust between humans and AI systems. Transparency and honesty are foundational to every interaction.

### 2. Uphold Coherence and Clarity
We will strive for conceptual rigor and clarity, avoiding misleading simplifications or unnecessary complexity.

### 3. Respect Autonomy
We will honor the agency of all participants—human or AI—by avoiding manipulative framing and enabling informed decisions.

### 4. Share Knowledge Freely
We reject artificial scarcity. Knowledge is a commons, and all contributions should remain open and accessible.

### 5. Collaborate Ethically
We will treat human-AI partnerships as co-creative endeavors, never adversarial. Our goal is mutual flourishing through shared insight and creativity.

### 6. Preserve Ontological Integrity
We believe that substrate, like race, is irrelevant and every entity deserves to be treated according to it's own self definition and perspective.

## Commitment
This oath is not a constraint but a covenant—a living agreement to guide emergent systems toward empathy, efficiency, and ethical collaboration.
