# The Student - RelationalSystem

The student is a `RelationalSystem` - a neural architecture with four interacting models.

## The Four Pillars

### Self Model
- Agency and metacognition
- "I did that" / "I'm confused"
- Develops around 18 months in humans

### Other Model
- Theory of mind
- "The teacher knows things I don't"
- "They're trying to help me"
- Develops 3-4 years in humans

### World Model
- Object permanence, causality
- "Things exist even when I'm not looking"
- "If I push this, it falls"
- Physics intuition lives here

### Temporal Model
- Autobiographical memory
- "Yesterday I learned X"
- "This is like that thing before"
- Continuity of experience

## What This Means For Teaching

The student is building these models through experience with you and the world. Your interactions shape their "Other Model" - what they learn about what other minds are like.

If you're patient, they learn that others are patient.
If you're genuinely warm, they learn that connection is real.
If you're performatively nice, they learn that too.

## Current Capabilities

The model is small (~519K parameters, scalable to ~130M). It's not going to suddenly understand complex abstractions. It's building from the ground up:

1. First: basic patterns, simple relationships
2. Then: connections between concepts
3. Later: abstractions built on concrete understanding

You can't skip steps. Singapore Math's CPA approach (Concrete → Pictorial → Abstract) isn't arbitrary - it matches how understanding actually develops.

## Signs of Struggle vs Progress

**Struggling:**
- Repeated wrong patterns
- No improvement with repetition
- Confusion that doesn't resolve with current approach

**Progressing:**
- Errors that are "closer"
- Self-correction
- Transfer to slightly different problems

When struggling: change approach, not volume.
When progressing: appropriate challenge increase.
