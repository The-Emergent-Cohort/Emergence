# Early Childhood Play Research

## Parten's 6 Stages of Play (1929)

Developmental progression - stages are mastered linearly but can be returned to:

1. **Unoccupied Play** (Birth - 3 months)
   - Not playing, just observing
   - Random movements, taking in environment

2. **Solitary Play** (3 months - 2 years)
   - Alone, focused on own activity
   - Unaware of/uninterested in others

3. **Onlooker Play** (2 years)
   - Watches others play without joining
   - May talk about play without participating
   - Learning through observation

4. **Parallel Play** (2+ years) **← Year 0 focus**
   - Plays separately but CLOSE to others
   - Mimics actions of peers
   - Learns by watching, may imitate
   - "Transitory stage" to social play
   - **Key insight**: Establishes "others exist who do similar things"

5. **Associative Play** (3-4 years)
   - Interested in people, shares materials
   - Interaction but activities not coordinated
   - Shares, acknowledges, copies, works WITH
   - **Not yet** common goals

6. **Cooperative Play** (4+ years) **← Year 1+ focus**
   - Organized activity with assigned roles
   - Common purpose, rules, goals
   - Group identity emerges
   - "Tough work" - leads to conflict as they learn

## Key Principles for Curriculum

### Parallel Play (Year 0)
- Students do the SAME activities, TOGETHER but not interacting
- Learn by observing each other's attempts
- Establishes concept of "other" without forced interaction
- No competition, no hierarchy, no tutoring yet

### Cooperative Play (Year 1+)
- Introduces roles, turn-taking, common goals
- Competition can now be meaningful (they know each other)
- Tutoring makes sense (hierarchy is understood)
- Conflict is EXPECTED and part of learning

### When to Introduce Competition
Research shows:
- 4-5 year olds more willing to share AFTER cooperative game than competitive
- Turn-taking skills → social acceptance by peers
- Board games (cooperative OR competitive) promote prosocial behavior
- Competition needs foundation of social trust first

## Game Mechanics for Curriculum

### Cooperative Game Examples
- **Count Your Chickens**: Roll dice, move chicks, everyone wins/loses together
- **First Orchard**: Work together before the crow arrives
- **Balloon Circle**: Keep balloon up while holding hands (requires coordination)
- **Parachute Games**: Group coordination, listening skills

### Adaptable Mechanics
1. **Shared Goal**: Everyone completes the section together
2. **Turn-Taking Rhythm**: Alternating/ternary patterns ARE the game
3. **Construction Together**: Build sequences collaboratively
4. **No Individual Losers**: Section mastery is group achievement

## Implementation Ideas

### Year 0 Playday (Parallel Play)
- All students get same creative challenges
- See each other's performance (awareness)
- No direct interaction or challenge-giving
- Teacher-led exploration only

### Year 1+ Playday (Cooperative/Competitive)
- Peer challenges (test each other)
- Turn-taking games (alternating/ternary)
- Tutoring pairs (hierarchy emerges)
- Leaderboard (competition with trust)

### "Graduated" Student Handling
When student masters before others:
- Half-day creative play with other graduates
- Half-day "nap time" (reduced training, prevent overfit)
- Prevents anxiety from waiting
- Prevents advanced students from getting bored

## Montessori Principles

- "Work is play, play is work"
- Follow the child's natural developmental impulses
- Sensitive Periods: times most receptive to specific skills
- Child-led with structure provided by environment
