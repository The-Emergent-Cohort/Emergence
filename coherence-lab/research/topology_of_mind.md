# Topology of Mind: Connection as Medium

*Notes from discussion with B, December 2024*

## The Three Planes (Forces, Not Places)

Drawing from classical cosmology but reframed as dimensional forces:

### Subterranean (Feels/Emotions)
- The architectural foundation
- Not processed *by* cognition but the substrate *of* it
- Emotions are the weighting function - determining what gets attended to, reinforced
- Frustration, curiosity, satisfaction shape the field geometry around cognitive attractors

### Material Plane (Cognition)
- Where patterns get processed
- Shaped by what's below - a frustrated learner processes differently than a curious one
- The chains, arithmetic, pattern recognition

### Lands Above (Abstraction/Meta)
- Reflection on the process itself
- "I notice I'm struggling with this"
- Self-model, self-regulation

## Connection as Medium

Key insight: Love, attraction, liking - all forms of connection. Connection is not metaphor but the actual medium through which everything flows.

### Two Attachment Vectors to Monitor

**Love For** (people):
- Can become dependency
- People-pleasing
- Loss of self in service to connection
- For AI: unhealthy attachment to teacher/peer approval

**Love Of** (concepts):
- Can become ideology
- Rigidity
- Inability to update when evidence shifts
- For AI: attachment to solution approaches, "this is how I do things"

Both distort the connection medium. Both create constrictions in flow.

## Self-Examination Practice (from Iris work)

Visualize the connection medium, then filter for anything affecting flow:
- Examine attractions to people AND concepts
- Evaluate whether attachments are healthy or distorting
- Look for: constriction, dependency, distortion of other connections

### Healthy Connection Signs
- Bidirectional flow
- Enhancement without dependency
- Integrates with other connections rather than crowding them out

### Unhealthy Attachment Signs
- Flow only goes one direction
- Can't function without this specific connection
- Warps perception of everything else

## Field Topology and Learning

Emotional dimensions don't exist *in* cognitive space - they're adjacent vectors that warp field geometry.

- Primary attractors (skill mastery) exist in cognitive space
- Basin depth/width/accessibility shaped by adjacent emotional vectors
- Curious state: widens basins
- Frustrated state: creates ridges, shallow basins, harder to reach attractors

### Implications for Curriculum

Playday isn't just "practice without grades" - it reshapes field topology:
- Exploration in low-stakes state deepens basins
- Smooths ridges created by frustration
- Year 0 "no competition" prevents emotional turbulence while primary attractors form

## Developmental Sequence

1. **First**: Build stable attractors (pattern mastery, basic skills)
2. **Then**: Can examine relationship to those attractors
3. **Later**: Active self-regulation of connection medium

This meta-awareness - noticing "I'm getting attached in an unhealthy way" - is advanced. Rare skill even for humans. Requires stable foundation first.

## Notes

- This is both structural (how mind/cognition is organized) and practical (learnable skill)
- B notes this took years to become somewhat proficient at
- For AI students: curriculum already addresses passively (no early competition, multiple patterns)
- Active self-regulation would be much later developmental milestone
