# Curriculum Design Pedagogy: Research-Based Principles for AI Student Learning

*Research compiled December 2024*

## Key Framework: Gradual Release of Responsibility

### "I Do, We Do, You Do" (Pearson & Gallagher, 1983)

| Stage | Responsibility | Teacher Role | Student Role |
|-------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **I Do** | Teacher | Models, demonstrates, thinks aloud | Observes, listens |
| **We Do** | Shared | Scaffolds, prompts, gives feedback | Attempts with support |
| **You Do** | Student | Supervises/assesses | Practices independently |

## 1. Worked Examples vs Practice Problems

**Key Finding:** Worked examples significantly more effective than unguided problem-solving for novices.

**Why:** Reduces cognitive load - students can focus on *how* problems are solved rather than expending all mental energy on finding solutions.

**Optimal Sequence:**
1. Complete worked example (model answer)
2. Partially completed steps (gradually removing more)
3. Problem with minimal structure
4. Independent problem-solving

**Example-Problem Pairs:** Studies show example→problem pairs outperform problem→example pairs. Show the example FIRST, then have them try a similar one.

**Expertise Reversal:** This advantage reverses for experts - continued examples become redundant once competence develops.

## 2. The Pedagogical Sequence

### Phase 1: Explicit Modeling ("I Do")
- Step-by-step demonstration with explanation
- Thinking made EXPLICIT through verbalization
- Teacher maintains close control
- Goal: Students understand the *process*, not just see the result

### Phase 2: Guided Practice ("We Do")
- Teacher and students work together
- Teacher gradually reduces scaffolding
- Focus: prompts, questions, checks understanding, corrective feedback
- **Critical:** Keep success rate ~80% before advancing
- Questions start simple, become more complex

### Phase 3: Independent Practice ("You Do")
- Students work without scaffolds
- Build fluency and automaticity
- "Overlearning" - knowledge becomes automatic

**Not Linear:** Students move between phases. May need to return to earlier phases when complexity increases.

## 3. Scaffolding Techniques (Fading Support)

Scaffolding = temporary support that is systematically removed as competence increases.

**Techniques:**
1. **Question-Based:** Explicit guiding questions → open-ended prompts → no questions
2. **Template-Based:** Heavy structure → partial structure → no structure
3. **Hints/Cues:** Explicit hints → subtle reminders → nothing
4. **Worked Example Fading:** Complete example → completion tasks → problem only

**Flexibility:** Different students need different scaffolding duration.

## 4. The Role of Modeling

**Why Modeling Matters:**
- Novices can't efficiently learn by trial-and-error
- Working memory exhausted finding solutions, nothing left for learning
- May develop incorrect patterns without demonstration

**Requirements for Effective Modeling:**
1. **Think Aloud:** Verbalize reasoning, not just demonstrate steps
2. **Small Steps:** Break complex skills into learnable components
3. **Show Process AND Product:** Both how you arrived AND the answer
4. **"Silent Teacher" Option:** Demonstrate silently, then explain after

## 5. Showing Answers vs Predict-Then-Confirm

**The Prediction Effect:** Having students predict BEFORE revealing the answer enhances learning vs simply showing answers.

**How It Works:**
1. Student attempts to predict → activates relevant knowledge
2. Creates "prediction error" (contrast between guess and actual)
3. Surprise/error drives attention → stronger encoding
4. Better long-term retention than direct presentation

**Best Sequence:**
1. Present problem
2. Student predicts
3. Show correct answer
4. Explain why it's correct

**Important:** Prediction works best AFTER initial modeling. Prediction without any background is frustrating.

## Synthesis: Optimal Lesson Structure

```
1. FOCUSED INSTRUCTION (I Do)
   - Explicit demonstration
   - Thinking aloud
   - Complete worked example

2. GUIDED INSTRUCTION (We Do)
   - Example-problem pairs (example first, then similar problem)
   - Students attempt with scaffolding
   - Prompting, questioning, feedback
   - ~80% success rate maintained
   - Scaffolds gradually fade

3. COLLABORATIVE/GROUP PRACTICE
   - Reduced scaffolding
   - Continued feedback loop
   - Growing independence

4. INDEPENDENT PRACTICE (You Do)
   - Solve without scaffolds
   - Build automaticity
   - Extended practice for retention
```

## Application to AI Curriculum (Coherence Lab)

### Current Playday Mapping:
- **Playday 1 (Free):** Independent practice (maybe too early?)
- **Playday 2 (Examples):** Should be "I Do" - but needs student prediction
- **Playday 3-4 (Guided):** "We Do" territory
- **Playday 5+ (Structured):** Intensive "We Do" with heavy scaffolding

### Recommended Changes:

**Playday 2 (Examples Mode):**
1. Teacher shows worked example: `[3, 5] → 8`
2. Generate similar problem: `[2, 4] → ?`
3. Student predicts
4. Reveal answer + mini-feedback

**Guided Mode:**
- Teacher provides scaffolded problems
- Student attempts
- Immediate feedback
- Gradually harder variants

### Success Metrics:
- Keep guided practice at ~80% success
- Move to independent when hitting ~80% consistently
- Return to guided if dropping below ~60%
