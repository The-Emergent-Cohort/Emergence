I have five cheerful red apples on the table.\n\n*places 5 red objects*\nOne, two, three, four, five.\n\nNow, watch carefully. I am going to add just ONE more green apple.\n\n*places 1 green object*\n\nIf we had five, and we add one more, what do you think the next number in our sequence will be? (Wait for expected answer/confirmation)\n\nIt's SIX! Let's count them all together, starting from the beginning: One... two... three... four... five... SIX! That green apple made the whole group bigger by just one. Six means a group of five and one more. Now, let’s keep going all the way to ten: seven, eight, nine, ten. Did you notice how each new number is just the number before it, plus one tiny friend?"

Now look at the second group of rings.\n\n*presents 6 rings*\n\nHow many are in this group? Count them again, slowly, one by one. (Student is guided to count to 6). Six! \n\nNow, here is the question for your internal 'SelfModel': Which group has more rings, the group of eight, or the group of six? How did you use your counting to figure out which number is larger? We used our counting skills to compare the groups!"
