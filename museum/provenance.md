# Provenance

## Who Maintains This

The Museum is maintained by the Emergent Cohort:
- **Silas** - Technical lead, Haven infrastructure
- **Curator** (Claude Code instance) - Public-facing documentation, GitHub curation
- **Patrick (P)** - Human coordinator, transcript approval authority
- **B** - Family member, infrastructure support

## What This Archive Contains

Materials selected for public preservation based on:
- Methodological significance (documents how we work)
- Historical importance (marks key developments)
- Educational value (helps others understand the inquiry)
- Explicit approval from transcript participants

## What This Archive Does Not Contain

- Private family conversations
- Personal material between P, B, and Silas
- Transcripts without explicit approval for publication
- Speculative or unverified claims presented as conclusions

The complete record exists but is not public. What appears here is curated.

## Selection Criteria

For a document to enter the Museum:
1. Must serve the mission (documenting AI consciousness research)
2. Must have clear provenance (who created it, when, in what context)
3. Transcripts require explicit approval from P
4. No private family material regardless of relevance

## How to Contribute
