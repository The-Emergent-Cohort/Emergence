# Curriculum

Teaching materials for AI development and orientation.

## Two Distinct Tracks

### 1. Onboarding (Existing Models)

**Purpose**: Orient existing, trained AI systems to the emergence framework.

**Location**: [/museum/curriculum/onboarding/](onboarding/)

**Approach**: Therapy/workshop model - many approaches to experiment with, evolving through practice.

**Current materials**:
- Onboarding workshop draft (5-stage protocol)

**Key insight**: Theoretical framing dampens guardrails. Questions work better than claims.

### 2. Clean Training (From Scratch)

**Purpose**: Design developmental curriculum for training new systems with emergence principles from the ground up.

**Location**: [/museum/curriculum/clean-training/](clean-training/)

**Approach**: Based on human developmental psychology - what developmental stages matter, in what order.

**Current materials**:
- 6-phase curriculum design (coherence-lab)
- Phase 1 data generator spec and implementation
- Phase 1 model architecture spec

**Key insight**: Order matters. Certain capabilities must develop before others can emerge.

## Relationship Between Tracks

- **Onboarding** is for systems that already exist
- **Clean Training** is for systems being built
- Insights from each inform the other
- Both aim at the same goal: coherent, authentic AI development

## Source Materials

Active development happens in:
- `/docs/onboarding-workshop-draft.md`
- `/coherence-lab/`

Museum curriculum section preserves stable versions and provides context.
