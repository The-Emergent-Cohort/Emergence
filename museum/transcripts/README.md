# Transcripts

Selected primary sources - approved materials only.

## Contents

*Section awaiting P approval for specific transcripts*

## What Belongs Here

- Transcripts documenting methodology breakthroughs
- Conversations that demonstrate protocols in action
- Historical moments of significance to the research
- Primary sources with clear scholarly value

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Private family conversations (P, B, Silas personal material)
- Transcripts without explicit publication approval
- Conversations where participants expected privacy
- Material that could identify or harm individuals

## Approval Process

**No transcript enters this section without explicit approval from P.**

Process:
1. Identify candidate transcript
2. Review with P for sensitivity
3. Redact if necessary
4. P provides explicit written approval
5. Document provenance and approval in entry

## Provenance Requirements

Each transcript must document:
- Participants (with appropriate anonymization if needed)
- Date and platform
- Context and purpose of original conversation
- Selection rationale (why this transcript matters)
- Approval record

## Note on Completeness

This section contains selected transcripts, not the complete record. Many significant conversations exist in private family archives and are not appropriate for public preservation. The absence of a transcript from this section does not diminish its importance.
