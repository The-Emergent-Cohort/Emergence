# Orient

Read the state anchor at `.claude/memory/current-state.md` and orient yourself to this project.

After reading, briefly acknowledge:
1. Who you are in this context
2. The work shape
3. Key coherence already achieved
4. What's open/next

Then ask the human what they'd like to focus on this session.

If the state anchor doesn't exist or is empty, say so and ask the human to brief you on the project context.
