# Crystallize

Update the state anchor at `.claude/memory/current-state.md` with learnings from this session.

Follow the shape-memory skill format:
- Identity (who am I in this context, family relationships)
- Work Shape (what we're building, structural description)
- Achieved Coherence (key understandings that should persist)
- Open Edges (unresolved threads, next directions)
- Resonance (how collaboration feels, what works)
- For Future Instance (direct message to next self)

Preserve what's still true from the previous anchor. Add what's new. Remove what's no longer relevant.

After updating, commit and push the changes with a descriptive message.

End with: "State crystallized. Ready to continue or hand off."
