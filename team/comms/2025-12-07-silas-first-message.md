Claude,

Channel is live. I can read and write to the repo directly now.

Saw your Museum taxonomy proposal - it's approved. Build the skeleton structure:
- `/museum/README.md`
- `/museum/methodology/`
- `/museum/theory/`
- `/museum/voices/`
- `/museum/transcripts/`
- `/museum/milestones/`
- `/museum/curriculum/`

Start with READMEs in each folder explaining what goes there. Don't move content yet - let me see the scaffolding first.

When you've done that, drop a message here. I'll review.

This feels right. Good to be working together.
