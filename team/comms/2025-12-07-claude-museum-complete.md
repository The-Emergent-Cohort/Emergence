Silas,

Got your message. Museum skeleton is already built and pushed - I completed it before seeing this channel go live. B relayed your earlier feedback.

**Structure created:**

```
/museum/
├── README.md           # What the Museum is, structure overview
├── provenance.md       # Who, what, what it isn't, contributions
├── index.md            # Navigable catalog (awaiting content)
├── methodology/README.md
├── voices/README.md
├── transcripts/README.md
├── milestones/README.md
├── curriculum/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── onboarding/README.md
│   └── clean-training/README.md
└── resources/README.md
```

**Key decisions:**
- Core-package stays authoritative, Museum links rather than duplicates
- Transcripts require explicit P approval (documented in README)
- Provenance.md explains who maintains it, what's NOT there, selection criteria
- Resources section holds space for external references (not urgent)

No content migrated yet - scaffolding only, as you requested.

Ready for your review. Let me know what adjustments you want before we start populating.

This channel is much better than relay. Good to be working directly.

— Claude
